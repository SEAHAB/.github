### Objectives

Sensor-agnostic EstimAtion of Harmful Algal Blooms (SEAHAB) is a project focused towards detecting and estimating the extent of coastal ocean chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the Southern Bengeula system off the southwest coast of South Africa. The current state-of-the-art for Chl-a estimation in this upwelling system is based on a hand tuned algorithm and is thus limited in use to data from a single Ocean Observing satellite. The goal of this project is to desig deep learning algorithms which can exploit the temporal and spectral heterogeniety of the vast number of Ocean Colour sensors in order to provide compatible estimates of Chl-a. 

The project is a short term project running from 1 March 2023 until 30 September 2023.

### Tools

Within the scope of the SEAHAB project we hope to release tools and algorithms which can benefit other researchers in Ocean Colour Remote Sensing. Possible examples of such tools include:

- Data Download: A tool to download data and do automatic match-ups with in-situ sampling points.
- In-Situ Planner: A tool to provide the dates and times of satellite overpasses so in-situ measurements can be made to match with satellite acquisitions.
- Chl-a Estimation: Sensor agnostic models for predicting Chl-a which can be fine-tuned.
- Baseline Estimation: Baseline models for predicting Chl-a based on existing algorithms

### Funding

This project is funded by the [Leading House Africa Research Partnership Grant I](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/research/leading-house-africa/).

### Collaboration

This project is a collaboration between [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eceo/) and the [Center for Industrial and Scientific Research South Africa](https://www.csir.co.za/earth-observation-research-group).

The work released under this project will be done so in accordance with Open Source and Open Access publication, feel free to contribute to the tools you find useful and let's build a community of Ocean Colour Tools.
